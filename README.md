# Rhythm

## By [Sunil Shastry](https://www.sunilshastry.com/ "Sunil Shastry")

_**Rhythm** is an open-source software written in Python 3 programming language. Rhythm is free to download and use for everyone. The main objective of the software is to accurately fetch the lyrics of any and every song available\*._

_\*Every song available on the lyrics.ovh public API_

## Installation and Setup

Rhythm is designed and built using Python 3, it is recommend for the user to have Python 3.5 or a higher version of Python installed on their computer device. This is a console based application and consequently it is assumed that the user is aware of running a Python program on their console. However, if a person reading this is not aware of any basic command line interfaces (CLI), I have included a short reference below to get some idea on running the `main.py` Rhythm file (or any Python file in that regard).

Visit [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Download Python 3 for your device") to install Python 3 on to your device.

> To get started, open up your terminal or command prompt, and follow the given commands to familiarize yourself with the basic CLI commands.

#### Common Commands

- `pwd` _Print working directory (pwd)_ displays the path name of the current directory

- `cd` _Change directory (cd)_, changes from one folder to another. To enter a folder use `cd (foldername)` and to leave a folder use `cd ..`

- `ls` _List (ls)_ provides a list of all files with a directory

- `clear` _Clears_ information on the display screen to provide a blank slate

## Required Packages

The project is built using the Python 3 programming language and uses the following libraries:

- `requests` (https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

- `os`

- `rhythm` (No need to install, found in the project)

- `termcolor` (https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/)

- `colorama` (https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)

- `pyfiglet` (https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/0.7/)

**In order to have the Rhythm application running accurately, you must have the `requests` library installed, the rest can be omitted. However, the other packages can surely be nice to have, as they help Rhythm perform better in terms of the user experience.**

If you **do not** wish to view the Python documentation to install the required libraries or if you simply find the documentation a little complicated or intimidating, here is a short method to install a Python library through your **command prompt** or **terminal**.

- `pip install (package-name)`

- `pip install requests`

## How to Use Rhythm?

Once you have downloaded and installed the project files and the required Python libraries, head over to your terminal or command prompt. Since Rhythm is primarily based on the console, one can use the application through their terminal or command prompt only. However, Rhythm provides an option for the user to download external text files if needed. To run the Rhythm project, navigate to the project directory using some [CLI commands](https://dev.to/kymiddleton/reference-guide-common-commands-for-terminal-6no) and run the following command.

```
python main.py
```

If you are using a Mac, the above command may or may not work since Mac comes with a Python 2 version pre-installed on it already. To tackle this issue, please try running the following command.

```
python3 main.py
```

A full reference about running Python on the command line can be found [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/running-a-python-script)

Once you run the above command Rhythm does the rest, you can simply provide the basic information it seeks for. At one stage, you are given an option to either "view" the song lyrics or to download the entire song lyrics in a text file. By providing the file name for it, Rhythm will automatically download the text file for you and store in a directory named "downloads" present in the same folder as the Rhythm project directory. The lyrics to your song can be found there.
